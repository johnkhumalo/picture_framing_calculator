Picture Framing Calculator
to add  frame profiles go to line 410 in the code remember to seperate frame profiles with "," if you adding more than 1.But dont put the "," on the last profile for your code to run smoothly.
in line 446 increase, should there be a percentile change in prices provided all profiles are affectected please addjust "1.3" with the percentile increment. For example if there is 8% increase in price affecting all profiles then go to line 446 and add 10% to 1.3 i.e 1.3+0.1=1.4 subtitude 1.3 with the sum or difference , otherwise adjust prices individually.
